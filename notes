Setup
* install necessities
  * git
  * rvm
  * ruby
  * rails
* configure git
* pull repo, launch server, open site

some sample flow:
* fill in email creds
* take a picture - drag & drop - write hello message -> send hello
* change password + two step auth

Problems that might arise:
* how to resolve configs for apps? (sublime)
* not all the things we can do at first
  - during the setup let's gradually build the app - for example after pushing ssh key, we can update gemfile, bundle it and progress with the setup (for devs for example?)

Ideas
* resolve onboarding
* resolve mentor mundane tasks (tell about some flows, remind about hellos etc)
* have a common setup (editors etc, databases, npm, rvm > rbenv)
* adding new dependencies should be as easy as adding a line in yml file
* adding a new step should be really easy - how?
  * rich yaml file?
  * simple controller action?
  * maybe a model and use some wizardy? (maybe something that edyta did?)
* it should also be used as a checklist for onboarder and mentor?
  - maybe send summaries to them? (select2 that pulls data from people?)
  - if steps will be a yaml file it could be easily revised and corrected?
* tell the story behind the scenes
  - we've generated ssh keys
  - installed apps
  - etc

MVP:
install necessities
pull repo and fire app
have a single task to mark as done
framework for adding new apps
framework for adding new steps - markdown!
we can skip some hard stuff (pushing ssh keys? sending mails? puting all config files?)

Tasks:
* sidekiq
* run install in the background
* present first task
* enable check task as done


Additional to install:
* chrome
* iterm
* zsh
* postgresql
* pgadmin3
* mongo
* mysql
* karabiner
* Seil
* slack
* xcode
* screenhero
* great .dotfiles
* generate ssh keys
